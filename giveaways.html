								<p>There are currently 2 planned promotions.</p>
                <h3>Train Beacon Code Giveaway 1 (Sweepstake)</h3>
                <p><b>July 31 - August 3, 2021</b></p>
                <p>To celebrate 1 year of the To The Trains YouTube channel, we're giving away 2 iOS and 2 Android promo codes for the Train Beacon mobile app. The codes were kindly offered by Mobile Appz, the developer of Train Beacon.</p>
                <p><b>Terms and Rules</b></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>The giveaway will take place on the To The Trains Discord server.</li>
                  <li>The giveaway will start on Saturday 31 July at ~12:00 BST (UTC+1).</li>
                  <li>The giveaway will end on Tuesday 3 August at ~12:00 BST (UTC+1).</li>
                  <li>Entrants enter by reacting to the iOS or Android giveaway embed in the #giveaway channel.</li>
                  <li>Entrants can enter both giveaways, but will be asked to choose one platform if they win both. The other code will be re-rolled.</li>
                  <li>Entrants' Discord accounts must be compliant with Discord's Terms of Service. Users under the age of digital consent in their territory cannot use the platform, and thus, enter.</li>
                  <li>Entrants cannot use multiple Discord accounts to enter multiple times.</li>
                  <li>Winning entrants for both the iOS and Android giveaway will be selected at random with the use of a Discord bot.</li>
                  <li>Winning entrants must endeavour to contact Seb#9636 within 24 hours of the giveaway's conclusion. You may need to send a friend request before messaging.</li>
                  <li>If any winning entrants do not claim their prize, their prize will be allocated to another participant with a random re-roll with the use of an online utility (as to avoid re-rolling the other winner). The same 24 hour window will apply.</li>
                </ul>
								<p><b>Additional notes</b></p>
								<ul>
									<li>The codes were kindly offered by Mobile Appz, the developer of Train Beacon.</li>
									<li>This is not a paid product placement. To The Trains were offered the codes with no specific terms.</li>
									<li>Entrants should live on the island of Great Britain for full app functionality.</li>
									<li>Entrants should have access to either iOS 13+ or ARCore on Android for full app functionality.</li>
