								<h2>Keeping Safe during Covid-19</h2>
							</header>
								<p>I've been ensuring that I follow all government guidance and regulations, not only just affecting travel. This includes wearing a face mask at all times, sanitising regularly, and social distancing wherever possible. To help with this, I have also been travelling at off-peak times when it is likely to be least busy. Additionally, I have not been travelling during any lockdown periods and in and out of Very High Alert level & Tier 3/4 areas since these have been introduced.<br><br>If you have any questions about how I've been filming videos during these times, don't hesitate to contact me on Discord at Seb#9636. Stay safe, happy holidays and a happy new year, too!</p>
